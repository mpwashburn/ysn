            <p>We’re excited to introduce YSN’s newest program, Exploring Your Potential (EYP), a revolutionary online course that puts a fresh spin on career planning and workforce readiness.</p>

            <p>Presented in partnership with Peregrine Academic Services EYP helps students see who they really are, what they want, challenges they may experience, and new opportunity pathways for success. The program delivers real-world, forward-thinking, practical advice that is student-centered and applicable to their individual needs</p>

            <p>Using engaging lessons, inspiring videos, worksheets, self-assessments, and critical thinking activities, EYP transforms the perspective of the student from one of uncertainty and doubt into one of confidence and assuredness so the student’s potential will be realized.</p>

            <p>The EYP career readiness course is based on the critically acclaimed New York Times Best Seller Secrets of the Young & Successful by YSN’s CEO Jennifer Kushell, an internationally recognized thought leader on youth employment and entrepreneurship. Instructional content has been globally tested and validated to empower students and remove perceived career barriers.</p>

            <p>The four one-credit courses that comprise EYP are presented in a highly absorbing, interactive online format. Students are coached throughout the program with videos by Kushell.</p>

            <p>The service comes with an overall program guide along with course syllabi that include program, course, and section-level learning outcomes with assessments.</p>
            <p>EYP can be used as a stand-alone or companion curriculum and produces the following expected learning outcomes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Demonstrate a clear sense of self and career orientation.</li>
              <li>Develop the necessary skills to explore, investigate, and take action personally and professionally.</li>
